# Hangman
First Project for JavaScript Fundamentals Class

Written by Victoria Forrest

The goal is to build a Hangman Type Game, where you guess the letters of a word. The game is written in JavaScript and uses node.js in Visual Studio Code. To start the game, run `node .` To end the game, press `ctrl + c`. You will be prompt to enter a letter. Press enter when you type the letter. Keep going until the game is done. There is a 6 letter limit to wrong answers.
